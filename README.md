# Epic Trip

Epic Trip is a calendar tool that helps you plan events by showing you spatial information between events.

Say you're planning a trip to Europe. There are some events you can't miss like meeting up with friends on certain days or you want to attend a conference, or you know that you have to return home by a certain date. Other than that, your trip is wide open. Epic Trip allows you to view these events as a list with helpful indicators like how many days you have between your conference in Barcelona and meeeting your friend in Paris. Epic Trip will show that you have 3 days to get to Paris after the conference is over to meet your friend. If for some reason your friend decides to postpone their trip for couple days, just change the date in Epic Trip and all the spatial information is updated for you.

Maybe the day you leave home for this trip is flexible. US citizens are allowed to stay in certain European countries for 90 days without a visa. The information that Epic Trip provides will make it trivial for you to make sure you choose a date that is within 90 days of your departure date so you don't violate any laws. Epic Trip does all the calculations for you.
